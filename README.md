If you click into the box that is green, red, or gray, you will be able to type out events that will happen or have happened that day. Click the blue save button, and then the data will be saved to local storage. This allows you to navigate away from the page and your data will still persist that day.

Items you save will turn red when the current hour is the same as the hour you set it to. The image below shows how it will look.
